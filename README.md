# CS359 Project 2: Understanding Cache Memories

This is one of the labs in the course Introduction to Computer Systems. In this lab, we are first required to write a cache simulator which chooses victims with Least Recently Used Algorithm. Then we are required to optimize matrix transposition function with waside blocking method.

csim.c is the source file of the cache simulator and trans.c is the source file of matrix transposition function.
